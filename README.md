# Queens-Demise (Original Text Game)
Hello!
This is my first project for a game dev class in college. Coded in python 3.2.5, should be able to run on any version higher than that.
I ended up doing a 2D version using pygame, check my profile for that version (I actually knew what classes are when I did that project versus this one.)
